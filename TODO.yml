App Restructuring
- Repositories
    - All Queries are laid out in the repositories
    - A base repository will provide a find, all, create, update, delete (via a protected $model_name field).
    - All repositories should be built as singletons in the IOC
    - Methods that return a single item should return an instance of a model.
    - Methods that return multiple items should return a Illuminate\Support\Collection of models
    - Repositories:
        - Contest
            - Get the current contest
        - Problem
            - Get the problems for a current contest
        - Solution
            - Get the solutions for a given problem
            - Get the judgeable solutions for the current contest
        - SolutionState
            - Get the pending solution state
    - Models:
        - Small classes that wrap database rows
        - Provide business logic associated with a database row
        - NOT coupled to database design, but should utilize what Laravel offers 
    - Controllers:
        - Should be thin, and rely on the models and repositories to manipulate data

- Debate
    - How to return data from database?
        - As Model class?
            - Pro: Associate methods with database row, giving database logic.
            - Con: All repositories (for different db engines) must return this format
        - As Array?
            - Pro: Regardless of database, this is the format that is most universal
            - Con: Cannot directly associate business logic with a database entry
